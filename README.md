# Bubble Drop Godot 4

## About the Game
Bubble Drop is a game where a small animal (could be an insect) uses a bubble wand to create bubbles that act as 1 use platforms. The goal of this small animal is to reach the ground safely, avoiding the various traps/hazards present around the level and without hitting the ground too hard.

## About The Versions
This game was during the Global Game Jam NS Dalhousie from January 24 - 26. The Jam version is the version for the jam that has bugs, and broken game loop. The Portfolio version you can share with your friend and family since it is a working game loop.
